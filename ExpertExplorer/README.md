# Expert Explorer
A Valheim mod that adds a new Exploration Skill to the game. Exploring and finding new points of interest will increase the skill. As the skill increase, so will the player's sight range (on the minimap.)

## Installation (manual)
BepInEx is required for this mod. Assuming BepInEx is already installed, locate the BepInEx folder in the Valheim installation directory (By default: C:\ProgramFiles(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Valheim\BepInEx) and navigate to the plugins folder. Unzip the contents of this package to a folder called "ExpertExplorer" within the plugins folder. This should be all that is required, assuming all mod dependencies are installed.
